# Heart-Disease-Prediction-project-using-machine
I recently completed a machine learning project on heart disease prediction. The model analyzed patient data such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other health factors to predict the likelihood of heart disease. This project highlights the potential of ML in healthcare for early diagnosis and prevention.
